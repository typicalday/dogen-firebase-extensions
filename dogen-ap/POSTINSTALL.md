# We're on it!

Once the extension indicates a Runtime Status of "Processing Complete", you can head to your Dogen Dashboard to launch your client.  In the meantime, you can check out the [Dogen docs](https://www.dogen.io/docs).

# Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please check out the [troubleshooting documentation](https://www.dogen.io/docs/troubleshooting#firebase-extension-issues).

# Monitoring

As a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.
